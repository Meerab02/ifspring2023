                <h3>Broadway</h3>
                <p>The musical made its world premiere at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. on October 31, 2017, and ran through December 3, 2017. Mean Girls began previews on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre on March 12, 2018, before opening officially on April 8, 2018. Casey Nicholaw was the director of the show and its choreographer, and the musical is produced by Lorne Michaels and Stuart Thompson. The musical has costumes by Gregg Barnes, scenic design by Scott Pask, video design by Finn Ross and Adam Young, lighting by Kenneth Posner and sound by Brian Ronan. It was announced on January 23, 2020, that the Broadway production has recouped its capitalization. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced theatres across the nation to close, the show halted performances on March 11, 2020, when Broadway shut down; it was later announced on January 7, 2021, that Mean Girls had closed permanently after 833 performances.</p>

                <h3>U.S. National Tour</h3>
                <p>The U.S. national tour began in Buffalo, New York, at Shea's Performing Arts Center, on September 21, 2019.

                <h3>Film</h3>
                <p>On January 23, 2020, Fey announced that a film adaptation of the musical was being produced.</p>

                <p>In December 2022, Angourie Rice, Reneé Rapp, Auliʻi Cravalho, and Jaquel Spivey were cast in the roles of Cady, Regina, Janis, and Damian, respectively. The film will be produced by Broadway Video and Little Stranger. Arturo Perez and Samantha Jayne will direct with Fey writing the film. Paramount Pictures will release the film on Paramount+. In February 2023, it was announced that the roles of Karen, Aaron, and Gretchen would be played by Avantika, Christopher Briney, and Bebe Wood, respectively. Fey and Tim Meadows will reprise their roles as Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall from the 2004 film, while Jenna Fischer and Busy Philipps are set to play Mrs. Heron and Mrs. George. Ashley Park, who played Gretchen in the original Broadway production, is set to make a cameo in the film.</p>

                <h3>West End</h3>
                <p>As of early January 2020, producers were in final talks of a West End production, and the show was expected to open in the late spring of 2021. Production was later brought to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in January 2021 producer Lorne Michaels said "We remain excited to bring this musical to the big screen, relaunch the tour and prepare for a London production."</p>
