        <h1>Vegan Coconut Macaroons</h1>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 25px;"><em>These homemade sweet, toasty macaroons are perfect for dessert or to fulfill your sweet tooth craving!</em></h4>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups Unsweetened Coconut Flakes, finely shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup Canned Coconut Cream, full-fat</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Maple Syrup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Coconut Sugar (or brown sugar)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup Gluten-Free All Purpose Flour, (or regular flour)</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of Sea Salt, optional</li>
            <li>1 cup Vegan Chocolate (optional)</li>
        </ul>   

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Add all the ingredients (except for the chocolate) to a large bowl and mix until fully incorporated. The mixture should form a sticky consistency.</li>
            <li>Scoop out 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time and form small balls. Make sure to pack tightly so that the macaroons do not fall apart while baking. Place the coconut macaroons on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. When the macaroons are done baking, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you are making chocolate-dipped macaroons, melt the chocolate using the double boil method or microwave method (described above). Dip the macaroons into the melted chocolate and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place them in the fridge for 5-8 minutes, or until the chocolate hardens.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
